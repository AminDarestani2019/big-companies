Uber Technologies revolutionized urban transportation with its ride-hailing app, founded in 2009. It connects riders with drivers via smartphones, disrupting traditional taxi industries. Uber expanded into food delivery (Uber Eats), freight, and autonomous driving. It operates in hundreds of cities globally, offering flexible income for drivers. The platform uses algorithms for dynamic pricing based on demand. Uber has faced regulatory challenges and debates over gig worker rights. It also invests in AI and electric vehicles to reduce emissions. The company went public in 2019. Uber aims to become the one-stop app for urban mobility. Its model inspired a wave of “Uber for X” startups.
