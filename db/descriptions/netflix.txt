Netflix started in 1997 as a DVD-by-mail rental service founded by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph. Early on, Netflix disrupted the traditional video rental industry by offering customers the convenience of ordering movies online and receiving them by mail, removing late fees and store visits.

As broadband internet became widespread, Netflix pivoted boldly toward streaming video in 2007, becoming one of the first to deliver on-demand entertainment directly over the internet. This shift radically changed how people consumed movies and TV shows, eventually making Netflix a dominant global streaming platform.

Netflixâ€™s success stems from a combination of technology, content strategy, and customer experience. They invested heavily in personalized recommendation algorithms to keep users engaged and pioneered the creation of original content starting with "House of Cards" in 2013, which helped distinguish Netflix from competitors.

Today, Netflix operates in over 190 countries with hundreds of millions of subscribers. Its data-driven approach and early bet on streaming helped transform the entertainment industry, influencing everything from content production to distribution and consumption habits worldwide.
