Meta Platforms, formerly known as Facebook, evolved from a small college social network launched in 2004 into one of the world’s largest technology companies. Founded by Mark Zuckerberg and his Harvard classmates, Meta’s early success came from connecting people through a simple, user-friendly platform that quickly expanded beyond universities to billions of users worldwide.

A key to Meta’s growth was strategic acquisitions, including Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014, which significantly broadened its ecosystem and established the company as a dominant player in social networking, messaging, and content sharing. Heavy investment in virtual reality technologies, exemplified by the acquisition of Oculus, signaled Meta’s ambition to move beyond social media into augmented and virtual reality.

In 2021, Facebook rebranded itself as Meta Platforms to focus on building the metaverse—a shared virtual space aimed at creating the next generation of social networks and immersive digital experiences. This shift involved substantial investment in VR and AR technologies and underscored Meta’s goal to pioneer a new digital ecosystem.

Despite facing significant challenges related to privacy concerns, regulatory scrutiny, and societal impacts of its platforms, Meta continues to innovate and expand its digital frontier, hoping to usher in a transformative new era with the metaverse.
